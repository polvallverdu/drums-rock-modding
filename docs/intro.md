# Custom Songs

Custom songs are natively supported by Drums Rock on the PC and Meta Quest versions. The process for installing them is a bit different. Let's dive into it:

## PC (Steam)

If you have your game on Steam, it's your lucky day! The process is very simple:

1. Head to the [Workshop Page](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1906020/workshop/)

2. Find the song you want to download, and press subscribe. The song will be downloaded automatically.

## PC (not Steam)

If your somehow not on Steam, you can still install custom songs. The process is not as easy as clicking a button, but still doable:

1. Download the song you want to add. You can find them on the [Official Discord](https://discord.gg/SaKrRtbtYD) under the [#custom-songs](https://discordapp.com/channels/920616318804328488/1118790399327219762) channel, or on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1906020/workshop/) with the [https://steamworkshopdownloader.io/](Steam Workshop Downloader) (You will need to have the game on steam, hopefully in a future we can have songs in a website like beatsaver).

2. Extract the zip file you downloaded. You should have a folder with the song name.

3. Go to the game folder. If you're on Steam find it by right clicking the game on steam, going to properties, local files, and then browse local files.

4. Navigate to the `CustomSongs` folder. It should be under `files/CustomSongs`.

5. Copy the folder with the song name into the `CustomSongs` folder. (not the files inside the song folder, the folder itself inside the `CustomSongs` folder)

6. Open the game and the song should be there!

## Meta Quest

You cannot install songs from the Meta Quest device directly. You will need to use a computer (an Android phone should work too, but won't be covered here):

1. Download the song you want to add. Follow the step 1 and 2 from the PC version steps without Steam.

2. Connect the Meta Quest to your computer.

   2.1. **NOTE FOR MACOS USERS ONLY** If on MacOS, you will need a program called [OpenMTP](https://github.com/ganeshrvel/openmtp) (since Android File Transfer has been discontinued).

   2.2. If the device doesn't appear, or isn't detected, make sure to go to the Meta Quest notifications, and click on the USB notification to allow file transfer.

3. Drag the song folder into the `CustomSongs` folder on the Meta Quest. It should be under `Internal shared storage\Android\data\com.garage.drumsrock\files\CustomSongs`.

4. Open the game and the song should be there!
